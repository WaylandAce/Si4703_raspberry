//Python Version 2 code
//The SI4703 reads starting at address 0x0A and starts writing to 0x02

//MANY THANKS to Nathan Seidle and his sketch example code at Sparkfun! I would have been lost without it.
//http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/Si4703_Example.pde
//Here is the SI4703 Datasheet that explains the registers
//http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/Si4702-03-C19-1.pdf

//Here is the SI4703 programming guide
//http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/AN230.pdf
//Anytime you READ the regsters it writes the command byte to the first byte of the
//SI4703 0x02 register. And then uses the list to write the 2nd bytes of register 0x02
//and continues until all the list is written!

//So the reg = i2c.read_i2c_block_data(address, zz, 32)  command
//writes the integer zz to the first byte of register 0x02.
// so after setting the first byte of 0x02 to what you want it to be you need to
//make sure every write or read keeps populating that byte with what you need there
